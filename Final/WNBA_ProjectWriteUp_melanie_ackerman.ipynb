    "Diana Taurasi is the best player in the WNBA. She's buried in accolades and broken records and was just named the WNBA GOAT (greatest of all time). The Phoenix Mercury coaching staff is looking to capitalize on her scoring abilities (more than they already do). They want to know if her scoring productivity is related to where on the court she shoots from in a given game. The coaches will use this information to inform new plays intended to set DT up to score. \n"
